## Community

### Community members  
The epidemiological parameter community is an inclusive, interdisciplinary and multisectoral global network of mathematical modelers, epidemiologists, librarians, information specialists, disease experts, decision makers and software developers. Community members span academia, NGOs, industry, and national and international public health agencies. The goals of the community are to collaboratively develop a global repository of epidemiological parameters as well as tools to support their use in analytical pipelines.
