## Submitting a pull request

[Pull Requests][pulls] are used for adding new documents to the repository, or editing the existing ones.

**With write access**

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
3. Make your change
4. Push and [submit a pull request][pr]
5. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged

**Without write access**

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
3. Make your change
4. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]
5. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Work in Progress pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something blocking you.

- Create a branch with a name that identifies the user and nature of the changes (similar to `user/branch-purpose`)
- Open a pull request and wait for a review 

## Contribute to community meetings
